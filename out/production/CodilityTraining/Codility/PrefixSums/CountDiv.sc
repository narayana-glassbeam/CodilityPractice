solution(2, 12, 4)==3

//For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2,
//your function should return 3, because there
//are three numbers divisible by 2 within the
//range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.

//Assume that:
//
//A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];
//K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];
//A â‰¤ B.
